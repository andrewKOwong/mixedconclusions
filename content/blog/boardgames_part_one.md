# Exploring Boardgames Part One: Data Download and ETL
TODO: link to part 2
## Introduction

During an elevator ride years ago, an elderly neighbour remarked on the fresh stack of Dominion[^1] boxes I was carrying. I casually replied something about it being "the golden age of board games", which is certainly something I personally felt during the 2010s, when it seemed that I was constantly discovering the existence of new board games with interesting mechanics that were much more complex than the games I played when I was a child. However, this little snippet of conversation occasionally resurfaces from the back of my mind over the years, for the simple reason that I, a scientist, did not like saying things without evidence.

And while I do consider myself enthusiastic about board games, I was never enthusiastic enough to, say, make an account on [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and participate in that gaming community online.

To acquire this evidence, 

## Data Download
### The BoardGameGeek XML API
All board games on BoardGameGeek (BGG) have a id assigned to them. For example, [Settlers of Catan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan) is located at `https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13/catan`, with an id of `13`. From manual probing of the URLs, it appears the current maximum id for boardgames specifically is somewhere around `362383`.

Board game data can be downloaded for the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) by URI of the form:

```HTTP
https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/thing?type=boardgame,&stats=1&id=1,4
``` 
where:
- `type=<boardgame|boardgameexpansion|etc.>` is a filter for that `type` and can be a comma-delimited list to get multiple types, or omitted to get everything
- `stats=1` gets ratings and other statistics
- `id=1,4,...` is a comma-delimited list of the boardgame ids.

&nbsp;

The API is also capable of returning information about users, guilds, and much more.

### Downloader Design
After 

Project folder structure[^2]

```
ðŸ“¦boardgames
 â”£ ðŸ“‚core
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“„bgg.py
 â”— ðŸ“„script_retrieve_all_boardgames.py

 ```

 This is probably overly conservative. But this may I could spend less than 20% of time actively maintaining a connection


- Resumability
- Server behaviour
- Functions

- Testing

## Summary and Discussion

## Notes
[^1]: [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion) is a card-based board game. A copious number of [expansions](https://www.riograndegames.com/games/dominion/) are available, each of which add new cards to the game. This results in players having to carry multiple boxes around to their friends' house, unless they pursue [alternate](https://imgur.com/a/oH2yj) [solutions](https://www.google.com/search?q=dominion+storage+box), or perhaps [play online](https://dominion.games/).
[^2] See this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19699059/representing-directory-file-structure-in-markdown-syntax) for this format of folder tree.
